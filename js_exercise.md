# JS exercise

## Do
1. **FIRST**, create a `<form>` with one input field (book title) and one button (save book).
1. **THEN**, on submit of the form, gather user's input, turn JS data into JSON data, and save to Local Storage in the form of an *Array of Strings*,
1. **AND** display the book title on the web page inside a `<h3>` tag,
1. **AND** reset/empty the book title input (so that the user can save a new title).
1. **NOW**, make sure that when the user adds another book title, it is added to the *Array of Strings* in Local Storage.

## Use
- `addEventListener`
- `JSON.stringify`
- `localStorage.setItem`
- destructuring (if possible)
